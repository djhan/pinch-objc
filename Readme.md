# Pinch

Retrieve a file from inside a zip file, over the network!

Pinch makes it possible to download a specific file from within a ZIP file
over HTTP/1.1

This is the Objective-C implementation. There are two demo projects, zipzapper which is an iPhone project and zipcommander which builds a commandline tool. Search for `Pinch_Example` 
in the projects to see usages of pinch.
